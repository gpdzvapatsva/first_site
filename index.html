        It is also the countryâ€™s most photographed attraction and its famous cable car took millions of people to its top.
        
        Table Mountain has become the single most welcoming icon to not only our people, but travellers from all over the world.
        
        But this mountain hides many surprises that wait to be discovered.
        
        It is much more than a scenic photograph background or a place from where you can take a breathtaking photo of Cape Town.
        
        There are about 2,200 species of plants found on Table Mountain and 1470 floral species. Many of these plants and flowers are endemic to this mountain.</p>

    <p>Robben Island is an island in Table Bay, 6.9 kilometres west of the coast of Bloubergstrand, north of Cape Town, South Africa. It takes its name from the Dutch word for seals, hence the Dutch/Afrikaans name Robbeneiland, which translates to Seal Island.</p>
